First in first out in cache memory 
# FIFO Cache Simulator 🧠💾

A simple and interactive **FIFO (First-In First-Out) Cache Simulator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project visually demonstrates how the FIFO cache replacement algorithm works, including **cache hits, cache misses, and pointer movement**.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Set custom cache size (1–10)
- ➕ Add numbers dynamically to the cache
- 🔁 FIFO replacement policy
- 🎯 Visual pointer to show the next replacement position
- 📜 History log showing HIT / MISS results
- 🔄 Reset cache at any time
- 🎨 Clean & modern UI (dark theme)

---

## 🧠 How FIFO Works

FIFO (First-In First-Out) replaces the **oldest element** in the cache when it becomes full.  
If a number already exists in the cache → **HIT**  
If not → **MISS**, and replacement happens when needed.
